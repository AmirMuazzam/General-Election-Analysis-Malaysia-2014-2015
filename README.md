# General-Election-Analysis-Malaysia-2014-2015
This project focuses on analyzing the General Elections (GE) held in Malaysia in 2014 and 2015. The analysis is conducted using Python, specifically Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.

Insights and Recommendations:
The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and feature selection techniques to predict election outcomes. The model demonstrates high accuracy on both the testing set and cross-validation, indicating the effectiveness of the chosen features and algorithms.

Noteworthy findings include:

The model's accuracy in predicting election outcomes suggests the presence of underlying patterns in the data.
The significantly higher accuracy for GE15 compared to GE14 may indicate distinct changes or trends in the dataset during those years.
This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and studying the electoral landscape in Malaysia during the specified years.
